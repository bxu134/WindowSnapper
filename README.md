## 🔐 First-Time Launch

Because the app is distributed without a Developer ID certificate, macOS may block it on first launch.

1. Try opening the app once (it will show a warning)  
2. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**  
3. Scroll down to find:  
   > “WindowSnapper was blocked from use…”  
4. Click **Open Anyway**  
5. In the confirmation dialog, click **Open**
6. On first run, the app will prompt for accessibility permissions.
7. Click **Open System Settings** and allow.

After completing either method, the app will open normally from then on.
